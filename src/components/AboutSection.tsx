                <p>
                  For over a decade, I've been blessed to serve the Lord through music, combining 
                  my passion for DJing with my calling to minister to God's people. What started 
                  as a hobby in church quickly became a divine mission to spread the Gospel 
                  through beats, rhythms, and melodies that inspire worship.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From intimate church gatherings to large-scale revival events, I've had the 
                  privilege of witnessing how music can break down barriers, heal hearts, and 
                  bring communities together in praise and worship.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My commitment goes beyond just playing music â€“ it's about creating an atmosphere 
                  where the Holy Spirit can move freely and where every beat serves a purpose 
                  in glorifying God.
